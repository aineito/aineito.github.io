<h3>Bilingualism and Language Processing Lab</h3>

<n0>The Bilingualism and Language Processing Lab at the National University of Singapore investigates native and non-native language processing/learning in bilinguals.
We mainly use eye-tracking and other behavioural measures to study these processes.<br><br>
<b>Lab meeting</b>: We have a weekly lab meeting in the graduate reading room (AS5-05-09) during semester time. If you are interested in attending, please subscribe to the psycholing mailing list <a href=https://groups.nus.edu.sg/NUSgroups/join.asp?groupname=psycholing>here</a> to receive announcements about upcoming meetings.
<br><br>
We have a poster introducing eye-tracking (created by Daiwen & Danning) <a href="https://nus-langsci.my.canva.site/">here</a>! (best with a mobile) <br>

		<b>Aine ITO</b>
		<p>My research investigates what makes it difficult to comprehend a non-native language efficiently and explores ways to facilitate non-native language processing with a focus on predictive processing. I am also interested in how orthographic information influences listening comprehension. I mainly use eye-tracking (visual world paradigm), EEG and reaction time measures in my experiments.</p>

				<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student in English Language and Linguistics at NUS and a member of Dr. Aine Ito’s lab. 
					My research interests center around implicit (language) learning, specifically investigating the occurrence of (linguistics) adaptation 
					through prediction error when faced with unexpected predictions. 
					I aim to examine how L2 English learners, with diverse L1 backgrounds, predict and revise their predictions during non-native sentence processing. 
					Utilizing eye-tracking measurement, I hope to make a valuable contribution to SLA and gain new insights into the question of whether prediction is an essential mechanism in (language) learning or not.</p>

						Besides, I find the gap in psychological processes of language comprehension between L1 and L2 speakers meaningful, as it implies how to facilitate L2 language processing.</p>
